# Maktab Student Management System

## 📚 Overview

A student management system for Islamic madrasahs and maktabs that centralizes student records, attendance, academic progress, and payments. The platform supports multiple curriculum tracks (Qaidah, Quran, Hifz), role-based access for admins, teachers, and parents, and provides parents with clear visibility into progress and attendance—reducing administrative overhead and replacing paper-based workflows.
